# Power-Plant-Predictions-using-ANNs
Predict the output power of a power plant using ANNs

The Data used for this project was obtained from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant

For this project, the Data was converted into CSV format and renamed to "Data_Regression.csv"

A neural network was trained and evaluated on the data. Then predictions were made.

This project was used for learning purposes, after studying Chapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks from the "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow" by Aurelien Geron.

Feel freee to play with the notebook, and please share any insights that you find.

Kind Regards
